I am an engineer based in Portland, OR. I received my MS in Computer Science from Portland State University in 2021. I previously interned at NASA Langley Research Center, where I worked on building models for time-series data from molecular dynamics simulations. My research interests include signal processing, modeling and simulation, and systems design. Past projects include a language for simulating analog computation, a library for digital systems design, and an analog synthesis engine. Recently I've been building Tropical, a realtime simulation enviroment for audio processing.
